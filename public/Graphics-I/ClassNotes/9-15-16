Peer Reviews: I am going to adopt this practice OR I think you can improve in this place by ____.
These comments must be actionable like the aforementioned examples...

Homogeneous Coordinates (projective):
- A coordinate system where multiplying a point by a scalar does not change the meaning of the coordinates
- Requires on extra coordinate than the number of dimensions that can be represented
- Can distinguish between direction and points
x,y,z,w is the coordinate system always (this semester).

Barycentric Coordinates:
- Two dimensional projective(homogeneous) coordinate system for triangles
- Used to interpolate fragment shader

Take a point in a triangle, the three segments created by the connection of that point are alpha, beta, and gama.
0 < a,b,g < 1

z = angle of rotation
dx = x cos(z) - y sin(z)
dy = y sin(z) + y cos(z)

Translation and Rotation are Rigid Body Transformations:
Never change the shape or volume of the transformed object

Symmetrical scaling is important to not change the shape.
Uses for non-symmetrical scaling: Ellipsoid. Make a sphere, Scale on direction more
Negative scaling gives a reflection
Shear? Moves some points farther based on their distance from some axis:

1 cot(z) 0 0
0  1     0 0
0  0     1 0 shears x with respect to distance in y
0  0     0 1

Perspective? Make things farther away smaller

Three coordinate systems:
- Object (0,0) is center of mass
- World (0,0) is center of world
- View (0,0) is center of the view

The solution to Gimbal Lock: Quaternion rotation
quaternions have three imaginary parts and one real part (a + bi + cj + dk)
i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1
