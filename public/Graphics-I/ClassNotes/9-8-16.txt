Lindenmeyer systems: Koch Snowflake: ----- -> --^--...

Fractals made from Lindenmeyer systems.

an L-system works with string replacement (turtle graphics)

F moves forward drawing a line, + rotates positive angle(clockwiase), - rotates negative angle(counter-clockwise)
x,y do nothing for drawing, but create the curve

Dragon curve:

Initial: Fx
Rules: 	x -> x+yF+
		y -> -Fx-y
Rotation: 45deg

Ex: Fx -> Fx+yF+ -> Fx+yF++-Fx-yF+

Each two iterations of the dragon curve draws half the length (each iteration is sqrt(2))

-----------------------

Each primitive is made of points and topology(optional)
Topology: Relationship between points. i.e. the graph of points remains the same.
The geometry may change throughout the graphics pipeline but the topology will not.

Hoomogenous Point Systems

x,y,z,w where w is 1 or 0. If it is zero the vector is a direction, else it is a point.
