        <h1>Git/HTML/CSS Blog Post</h1>
        <h3>Git</h3>
        <p>
            I am totally new to Git, so the recent exploration has been exciting for me!
            With Git's version control, I have been able to more quickly share, access, and edit all of my work over the
            different computers that I use for school. Most recently, I have been able to share my CS 5400 Graphics
            Homework over both of my computers making it extremely easy to move from one workstation to the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through messing around with Apache server I was able to get this website running and it has become so much
            easier to update the code I post on the website. I look forward to exploring Git in more detail to continue
            to improve my workflow.
        </p>
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
            HTML is a strange beast to me and it continues to mystify me in its simplistic complexity. Semantics are not
            something that I'm good with, and so HTML5's semantic driven tags (such as article, header, footer, etc.)
            are a struggle for me to adapt to and understand fully. I know they seem simple in nature, but finding the
            proper use for them has been difficult for me
        </p>
        <p>
            However, overall HTML5 is a wonderfully simple language that, with a little, you can do a lot. Static design
            isn't necessarily what the world is about these days, but HTML allows you some simplistic methods to getting
            your ideas out in the world, even if it doesn't necessarily make them pretty (by itself). I love being able
            to throw a few tags in, a couple of paragraphs, and BAM! my work is online for others to see (for good or
            bad).
        </p>
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>
            Two words: <em><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">ZEN GARDEN!</a></em> This site has opened my eyes to the beautiful (albeit foreign) world of
            design. I'll be the first to admit UI/UX is not my forte, but the dramatic change a stylesheet can bring to
            a set of words is remarkable. Can I bring about those changes? Of course not. Not yet, anyway. But knowing
            what is possible is half of the encouragement to learn, right? Which brings me to my next point...
        </p>
        <p>
            Will I learn to love the common styling seen on the internet these days? I'll admit it, I may be a
            fuddy-duddy, but the never-ending scrolling pages is something I have not yet come to appreciate. The
            infinite single page website is a huge drag to me and I wish people would move on from that style. But maybe
            it will grow on me. I certainly see the appeal of that sort of site on mobile, but from the perspective of
            someone who still does all of their serious internet time on a real machine with a monitor, I can get by
            without having to scroll for all of the information the website has on it.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            These technologies are brilliant and I am so grateful to be getting reacquainted with them. Six months ago I
            was adamant that I had no use for web-based programming (painfully aware of the multitude of opportunities my
            disdain was passing up) but I have entered this course with a fresh perspective and have so far been surprised
            by my increased interest, regardless of how little we have actually gone into the programming itself.
