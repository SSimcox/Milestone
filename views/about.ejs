            This website is dedicated to my progression in Web Development and Computer Graphics.
            I am currently a student at Utah State University studying for a Bachelor's degree in
            Computer Science. I am interested in creating projects in computer graphics to post
            here as well as documenting some of the things about web dev I find interesting or
            useful.

            I am currently studying in an introduction to computer graphics course. We are using
            WebGl to learn the basics of graphical programming which as of this writing provides
            support to OpenGl 2.0 calls. The book I am using is "Interactive Computer Graphics" by

            I am in an introduction to web development course learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            One of my major weaknesses is design. Layout and color composition are things that I struggle with
            as my personal preference is often vastly different to most people.
